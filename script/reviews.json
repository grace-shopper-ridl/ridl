      "It is just... okay. Flavor is acceptable and the nutritional value is what I want, but the consistency is not. Consistency was actually pretty gross, so gross I won't ever use it as a protein shake again (note, maybe you need an actual blender and not a blender bottle? I only used a blender bottle).\nTIP: Saw another user suggest mixing it with some whipping cream to create a mousse-like dessert. I tried this and enjoyed it, tasted like dark chocolate mousse. :)\nPS... mine also had those weird burn marks on the lid that someone else posted (but the foil seal was not broken).",

Then it's ready for the 8 shots I might have over the course of a day.\nIt keeps itself nice and clean and is smart enough not to rerun the cleaning cycle if it hasn't been off long enough to cool all the way down.",
